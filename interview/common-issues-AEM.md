Common issues in AEM include performance problems like slow page load times, content bottlenecks, and memory issues. Other challenges involve replication delays, indexing problems, and issues with Adaptive Forms. These issues can stem from improper configuration, lack of optimization, or under-resourced systems. 
* Performance Issues:
  - Slow Page Load Times:
      Pages may take a long time to load, impacting user experience and SEO. 
  - Content Bottlenecks:
- Difficulty managing and updating content efficiently, leading to delays and frustration.
- Memory Management Problems:
- Insufficient memory allocation or memory leaks can slow down the system and cause crashes.
- Replication Delays:
- Content might not replicate to all environments quickly, making it difficult to publish updates.
- Indexing Issues:
- Poor indexing can slow down searches and make it difficult to find content.
- Other Common Issues:
- Adaptive Forms: Issues with extracting fragments from XFA-based forms, XFA scripts, and other form-related functionalities can arise.
- Replication Queue: Blocked replication queues can hinder content publishing and synchronization.
- Dispatcher Caching: Incorrect Dispatcher caching configurations can lead to stale content being served.
- Integration Issues: Problems with integrating AEM with other systems, such as Target, can cause issues with personalization and targeting.
- Compilation Errors: Issues with Java or other code files can prevent AEM from starting or functioning correctly.
- Resource Loading Errors: Problems with loading templates, assets, or configuration files can also cause issues.
- Configuration Errors: Incorrectly configured AEM instances can lead to various problems.
- Version Compatibility Issues: Incompatibility between different frameworks, libraries, and plugins can cause issues.
- Out-of-Memory Errors: Insufficient memory allocation can lead to crashes and instability.
- Access Issues: Problems with user permissions or access to specific resources can occur.
